# Egypt Fake Tweets Detection (Beta)

## 🧠 Project Overview
This repository supports a machine learning project aimed at detecting **fake news in Egyptian Arabic** across social media platforms, especially **Twitter** and **Facebook**. It includes:

- A custom-labeled dataset of over **22,000** text samples.
- Labels: `f` (Fake), `r` (Real), `idk` (Unclear/Ambiguous).
- A classification pipeline using **TF-IDF** vectorization and **XGBoost** with semi-supervised learning to expand the label coverage.

This project is currently in **beta**, and the labeling process is still being improved and partially automated.

## 🗂️ Dataset
The dataset was generated by refining and relabeling Egyptian social media posts from an original massive corpus. We started with this base dataset:

➡️ [Two Million Rows Egyptian Datasets by Mostafa Nofal](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mostafanofal/two-million-rows-egyptian-datasets)

And released a new, refined version with added fake news classification labels:

➡️ [Egypt Fake Tweets Detection Dataset (Labeled) by Mahmoud Elgendy](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mahmoudelgendy68/egypt-fake-tweets-detection-dataset-labeled)

## 📦 Contents
- `labeled_40k.csv`: Main labeled dataset (only `Text` and `Label` columns preserved).
- Semi-supervised training notebook using initial human labels and confident model predictions.
- TF-IDF vectorizer and XGBoost model setup for text classification.

## 📊 Label Distribution (Current)
```
idk    ~69.8%
r      ~23.1%
f       ~7.1%
```

## 🚀 Getting Started
To run predictions on new samples:
```python
input_text = "اكتب هنا النص"
X_input = vectorizer.transform([input_text])
predicted_class = model.predict(X_input)
predicted_label = label_encoder.inverse_transform(predicted_class)[0]
```
